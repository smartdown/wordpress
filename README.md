# Smartown via Wordpress

Examples and tools to support Smartdown via Wordpress

Here's what I'm using to do Smartdown on WP.

I have the 'Scripts n Styles' Plugin installed. Note that it is 'Scripts n Styles' and not 'Scripts And Styles'. The official link is:
  https://wordpress.org/plugins/scripts-n-styles/

There may be other plugins that provide the same functionality, but this is the one that I had access to.

Using the plugin, I can add the following content to the Scripts tab, in the `<body>` section (as opposed to the `<head>` section):

[Scripts-n-Styles-body-script.js](Scripts-n-Styles-body-script.js)

When using Scripts n Styles, remember to hit the 'Update Scripts' button to get your changes saved properly.
